# orbs:
#   # The Node.js orb contains a set of prepackaged CircleCI configuration you can utilize
#   # Orbs reduce the amount of configuration required for common tasks.

# jobs:
#   build-and-test:
#     docker:

#     # Then run your tests!
#     # CircleCI will report the results back to your VCS provider.
#     steps:
#       # Checkout the code as the first step.
#       - checkout
#       # Next, the node orb's install-packages step will install the dependencies from a package.json.
#       # The orb install-packages step will also automatically cache them for faster future runs.
